# Hissab
"Hisaab‚Äù is a comprehensive project where I created a user-friendly business accounting software. The application enabled users to generate professional bills, accurately calculate profits, and visualize sales data through interactive graphs. Leveraging SQL connectivity and Python, I developed a robust and intuitive solution for efficient financial management.
